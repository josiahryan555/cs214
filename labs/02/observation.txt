Flex Example 1: 
	Near line 695:
		I see a do statment that checks if the current state is accepting, if it is, then it sets two variables.  
		a few while statements that do actions based on the current state	  
	Near line 740 - 770:
		a swich block with cases that respond to the users inputs and execute the commands that specified in my example1.lex file  (if start is typed, "Start command received\n" is printed)

Flex Example 2:
	when I typed in J_O_S_I_A-_H, it responded with 
							WORD
							_WORD
							_WORD
							_WORD
							_WORD
							-_WORD
	It recognizes the letters as words, but doesnt recognize _ or - and so just prints them 

Flex Example 3:
	when I ran ./example3 < StudentInfo.h, it idintified every article that was used in the class definition, catagorizing every token as a KEYWORD, INDENTIFIER, PUNCTUATION, OPERATOR, DOUBLE, or INTEGER.
	this is a first step toward parsing as there is a 'dictionary' that can recognize what is and isnt in the language and what each thing is seperatly in the language

Flex Example 4:
	terminal vs non-terminal: a terminal (heat_switch, temerature_set) they perform a function, and go to nothing else, while a non-terminal goes to a terminal, a non-terminal or a combination, but itself doesn't perfom a function
	I don't see anything unexpected, It doesn't expressly say what temperature or what state it was set to however, which would be helpful.
