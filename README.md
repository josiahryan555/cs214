# CS-214: Programming Language Concepts

Projects made for my CS-214 class.  <br/> <br/> 
This class was designed to teach us to learn and understand programming languages.  We had 12 labs and 11 projects in which we were asked to write basic code in 4 languages: **Java**, **Ada**, **Clojure**, and **Ruby**.  
<br/> <br/>
Here are my projects!
